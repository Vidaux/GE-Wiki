                  <h2>14. GENERAL</h2>Agreement: These Terms of Service constitute the entire Agreement between you and WikiFoundry and governs your use of the Site, superseding any prior agreements between you and WikiFoundry. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when you use affiliate services, third-party content, or third-party software. WikiFoundry's failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Choice of Law and Forum</b>: By visiting the Site, you agree that the laws of the State of Washington and U.S. law, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern this Agreement.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Dispute Resolution</b>: THIS SECTION PROVIDES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF MOST DISPUTES OR CLAIMS THROUGH ARBITRATION INSTEAD OF COURT TRIALS AND CLASS ACTIONS. YOU SHOULD READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY; ARBITRATION IS FINAL, BINDING, AND SUBJECT TO ONLY VERY LIMITED REVIEW BY A COURT. THIS SECTION GOVERNING DISPUTES WILL SURVIVE ANY TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Mandatory Arbitration</b> &ndash; YOU AND WIKIFOUNDRY AGREE TO ARBITRATE ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE ARISING UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT THAT YOU OR WIKIFOUNDRY MAY BRING AN INDIVIDUAL ACTION IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT. YOU AND WIKIFOUNDRY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS AGREEMENT EVIDENCES A TRANSACTION IN INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND THAT THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT WILL GOVERN THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION. TO INITIATE ARBITRATION, YOU OR WIKIFOUNDRY MUST FIRST SEND A WRITTEN NOTICE, VIA CERTIFIED MAIL, TO THE OTHER PARTY INDICATING AN INTENT TO ARBITRATE, WHICH WILL INCLUDE: (1) A DESCRIPTION OF THE FACTS; (2) A DESCRIPTION OF THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM; AND (3) THE RELIEF SOUGHT ("NOTICE TO ARBITRATE"). SEND NOTICE TO ARBITRATE TO: WIKIFOUNDRY.COM INC., ATTN: ARBITRATION, 710 SECOND AVENUE SUITE 1100, SEATTLE, WA 98104. BOTH PARTIES AGREE TO MAKE REASONABLE ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE ANY SUCH DISPUTE; HOWEVER, IF THE PARTIES CANNOT RESOLVE THE DISPUTE WITHIN FORTY-FIVE (45) DAYS OF RECEIPT OF NOTICE TO ARBITRATE, THEN AN ARBITRATION CLAIM MAY COMMENCE. ANY ARBITRATION INITIATED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE ADMINISTERED BY THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION ("AAA") IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS ARBITRATION RULES (AND THE AAA SUPPLEMENTAL PROCEDURES FOR CONSUMER-RELATED DISPUTES AS THEY MAY BE APPLICABLE), AS MODIFIED BY THIS AGREEMENT. INFORMATION CONCERNING THE AAA, ITS ARBITRATION RULES, AND OTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING ARBITRATION PROCEDURES AND FEES CAN BE FOUND BY CALLING THE AAA AT 1-800-778-7879 OR VISITING ITS WEBSITE AT: http://www.adr.org.<br>
                  <br>
                  ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED BY A SINGLE NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR. YOU AND WIKIFOUNDRY WILL COOPERATE IN GOOD FAITH TO SELECT THE ARBITRATOR WITHIN THIRTY (30) CALENDAR DAYS OF THE COMMENCEMENT OF ANY ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. IF YOU AND WIKIFOUNDRY CANNOT AGREE UPON A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR WITHIN THE THIRTY-DAY PERIOD, THEN EITHER PARTY MAY REQUEST THAT THE AAA APPOINT, IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION, A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR. YOU AND WIKIFOUNDRY FURTHER AGREE THAT NO ARBITRATOR WILL HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO AWARD ANY RELIEF OR REMEDY IN EXCESS OF OR CONTRARY TO WHAT IS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT, EXCEPT WHERE SUCH PROVISION IS NOT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. THE ARBITRATOR'S DECISION AND AWARD WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING, AND JUDGMENT ON THE AWARD RENDERED BY THE ARBITRATOR MAY BE ENTERED INTO IN ANY COURT HAVING JURISDICTION. THE LAW THAT IS APPLIED TO THIS AGREEMENT ALSO WILL BE APPLIED IN ANY ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. ALL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND FEES OF THE ARBITRATION WILL BE BORNE EQUALLY BY YOU AND WIKIFOUNDRY. YOU AND WIKIFOUNDRY WILL EACH BEAR THE EXPENSES OF ITS OWN COUNSEL, EXPERTS, WITNESSES, AND THE PREPARATION AND PRESENTATION OF EVIDENCE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY ARBITRATION.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Waiver of Jury Trial and Class Actions</b> &ndash; BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND WIKIFOUNDRY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE TO WAIVE CERTAIN RIGHTS TO LITIGATE DISPUTES IN COURT, TO RECEIVE A JURY TRIAL, OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLAIM ON A CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. YOU AND WIKIFOUNDRY BOTH AGREE THAT ANY ARBITRATION WILL BE CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT A CONSOLIDATED, CLASS-WIDE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS AND THAT IF ARBITRATION IS NOT CONDUCTED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, THIS SECTION WILL BE DEEMED NULL AND VOID. THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD INJUNCTIVE RELIEF ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM. IF FOR ANY REASON THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT IS DEEMED INAPPLICABLE OR INVALID, OR THE EXTENT THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE ALLOWS FOR LITIGATION OF DISPUTES IN COURT, YOU AND WIKIFOUNDRY BOTH WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO PURSUE OR TO PARTICIPATE AS A PLAINTIFF OR AS A CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLAIM ON A CLASS OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS OR IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Severability</b>: If any of these terms shall be deemed invalid, void, or for any reason unenforceable, that term shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining terms.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Termination</b>: WikiFoundry may terminate this Agreement, or terminate or suspend your access to the Site and remove and discard any Submissions at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice.<br>
