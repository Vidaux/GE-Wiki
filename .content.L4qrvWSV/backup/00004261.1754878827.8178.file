                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">After reading (lurking?) these forums since beta, I&#39;ve noticed that many of the same questions pop up every few days. How good is UPC X? Is UPC X better than Stock Y or UPC Z? Is UPC X good for end game?</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">Unfortunately, most of these questions are not answered accurately, since the majority of forum lurkers either haven&#39;t played enough of a UPC to give quality insight or haven&#39;t used them in the manner the poster is asking of (end game raids, colony wars, etc). I also see people quote segments from the OTHER UPC guide on these forums in order to answer questions... which saddens me. The creator of that guide did not play the majority of UPCs as extensively as he stated, which is clear in several of his inaccurate observations, such as his unnatural obsession with vet stances.</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">Thus, this is my attempt at creating a more comprehensive UPC guide that should be able to help both new and veteran players when they are trying to fill a specific role in their barracks. I am going to account for both nerfed and unnerfed stats (since we were previously promised an unnerf at some point in time, unnerfed stats will be included in parentheses). I am going to rate characters on a scale of 1 (low) - 10 (highest) in the following categories:</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">PvE grinding [PVEG]</span> <span class="diffRemove">- Player vs Enemy Grinding from levels 1-100, consistent AE is prioritized, along with weapon choice and versatility</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">PvE powerleveling [PVEP]</span> <span class="diffRemove">- Player vs Enemy active powerleveling a lower level alt, spammable AE and fast kills are prioritized</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">PvE boss hunting [PVEB]</span> <span class="diffRemove">- Player vs Enemy fighting a non-raid boss, tankability, single target damage, or boss utility is prioritized</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">PvE endgame raid [PVER]</span> <span class="diffRemove">- Player vs Enemy end-game raid boss (Gerero, Diablo, Shapen, etc), case-by-case decision</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">PvE endgame farm [PVEF]</span> <span class="diffRemove">- Player vs Enemy end-game farming in 100+ maps, tanking, AE DPS and disables are prioritized, although single target dps is still important since many high level mobs have crazy hp, up to 35k!</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">AFK leveling [AFKL]</span> <span class="diffRemove">- Away From Keyboard leveling, fast attacks and kills without skills or buffs is prioritized. Also, most melee are penalized due to the fact that running around while AFK leads to death more often than not.</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">AFK powerleveling [AFKP]</span> <span class="diffRemove">- Away From Keyboard powerleveling a lower level alt, fast attacks and kills are prioritized, though this is different than AFKL since some normally weak attacks are enough to OHKO in certain areas (like shotguns)</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">PvP small-scale (duel or small teams) [PVPS]</span> <span class="diffRemove">- Player vs Player small scale duels (2-6 families), case-by-case decision</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">PvP large-scale (colony wars) [PVPL]</span> <span class="diffRemove">- Player vs Player large scale PvP (i.e. Colony Wars), strong AE dps and knockdown are prioritized, along with high aspd to destroy towers (all damage to a tower is 1 dmg, so high aspd is the only important factor)</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">These are the main areas in which players generally want some kind of specialized role. Some players just want to get to vet as fast as possible; some people don&#39;t mind a difficult grind if it provides them an advantage in some other role when they finally reach the top of the proverbial mountain. All numbers for stats and my ratings are based on our current nerfed stats; if a different number follows in parentheses, these reflect the future unnerfed stats that we have been promised.</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">Keep in mind that these are just my opinions. While I consider myself an experienced player, I&#39;ll be the first to admit I haven&#39;t leveled every UPC to 100. However, I&#39;ve had firsthand experience with most UPCs at all levels thanks to my clan, and even have friends who have participated in Colony Wars on other servers. Therefore, my projection for [PVPL] is an estimated score which I may tweak when we get Colony Wars ourselves. Also, these ratings and analyses are based on K2 Network&#39;s Sword of the New World; not any other version of Granado Espada.</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">Additionally, I may change ratings or comments based on feedback from other players. I&#39;ve already tweaked some of my ratings based on feedback from friends and other experienced SotNW players. Thus, this is most certainly a work in progress.</span><br>
                            <br>
                            <span class="diffRemove">Well, enough foreplay. Onwards and upwards!</span><br>

                            <br>

                            Armor: Leather, Metal, Shield<br>
                            Stances: Blandir Cruz, Penetrar Cruz, Back Guard, High Guard, Defender (Vet)<br>
                            <br>
                            Notes: Reboldoeux Soldier is basically like a stock fighter with far fewer stances, 1 less DEX, and no provoke. This doesn&#39;t make him automatically useless at certain tasks, but you can&#39;t shake the feeling that literally everything he can do, someone else can do better. He has a decent PVEG rating because even as a heavy weapon, Blandir Cruz is an effective grinding stance with 2 powerful AE (Bladespin and Tierra Choque). His PVER stat isn&#39;t particularly low due to the fact that he shares a similar role to fighters that aren&#39;t tanking on Gerero/Diablo - polearm dps. Unlike stock fighter, he has penetrar cruz (which has higher atk and aspd innate bonus than blandir cruz), and arpon is useful in small scale pvp. It also gives him a means to attack Hellbreaker.<br>
                            <br>
                            Unfortunately, several of his stances are useless without Provoke. Defensive stances like High Guard and Defender are pretty worthless if you can&#39;t keep aggro; Romina and Rescue Knight can at least resurrect in theirs. This limits his utility in both boss fights and PvP.<br>

                            Note: Unfortunately, someone needs to be at the bottom of the ranks, and it&#39;s clearly the kids (in this case, Ramiro). Their main problem stems from their below average STR, incredibly low CON, and the fact they use weaker weapons for their stances. However, this isn&#39;t all bad; most monsters in leveling areas are shell or partial, so replacing 2h swords with 1h swords actually bestows some extra damage bonus for Flow Guard, Roof Guard, and Sidewinder. 1h swords get dmg bonus on partial cover and suffer no dmg penalty against other armor types. Thus, he&#39;s not as difficult to grind as some would expect. However, his Main Gauche stances aren&#39;t too useful, since they are basically weaker versions of sabers (both are light weapons), and he can&#39;t use a shield in Back Guard.<br>
                            <br>
                            The only thing these kids have going for them are their runspeed (annoying in pvp but not incredibly useful since they are not feared), and attack speed (again, not too useful in pvp where ATK &gt; ASPD due to skill spamming). The kids aren&#39;t impossible to level, but there&#39;s almost no point since they excel at nothing at end game. At least you can be unique!<br>

                            <br>
                            Notes: As you can see from my ratings, Jack is an incredibly powerful character who is unfortunately overlooked by the majority of players due to his annoying looks and ease of obtaining. Allow me to explain my ratings:<br>
                            <br>
                            Jack excels in grinding, especially solo, almost on par with Cath. In fact, he&#39;s generally much less frustrating to grind solo than Cath due to the provoke-nature of his fences. The downfall is that he must stay in one place since his constructs are stationary, and not all zones have good spawn rate when staying in one spot (several zones have mobby areas but low spawn, meaning you need to keep moving to find the monsters).<br>
                            <br>
                            Unlike Catherine, he also has useful secondary stances with good melee stats. Trapper is nice for &quot;bulldozing&quot; an area prior to construction, and Penetrar Cruz is very useful against bosses; both mid-game and in raid. With 7 agi, he&#39;s especially useful at proccing status debuffs with a polearm, though his low CON makes him a bit vulnerable, his low STR reduces his DPS and his inability to use Blandir Cruz means he can&#39;t spam skills. His Safety Ward helps tanks when boss hunting, and his cannon/siegecannon turrets are incredibly powerful. Just keep in mind that like Catherine, his PVEB would be more like 1 if he were to solo. Have a good tank keep aggro, however, and he&#39;s one of the best dps upcs available.<br>
                            <br>
                            As a bonus, he&#39;s very useful at powerleveling alts; again, his only disadvantage is the stationary nature of his constructs. If you can find a good high-spawn area to camp, he&#39;s the best at powerleveling!<br>
                            <br>
                            For endgame farming, he&#39;s actually not too useful in 100-104 zones like Albertal, Bia Fluval and Deprimada since the spawn rate is rather low. However, when you get to 104+ zones like Frozen Plains and Snowfield, it&#39;s generally more effective to stay in one spot and let the spawn come to you (since mobs in these zones have upwards of 30k HP, mobbing and AEing is not really an option when solo). Jack excels at this activity, allowing for easy solo farming of high level zones.<br>
                            <br>
                            In small-scale PvP, it&#39;s too easy for the opponent to avoid the constructs since they can&#39;t move, plus they&#39;re easy to destroy in a well-placed AE. However, in Colony Wars, using cannon and siege cannon turrets to defend your base is an effective and annoying strategy as long as they can&#39;t be targeted by AE. Keep in mind that Jack&#39;s turrets cannot attack air.<br>
                            <br>
                            As a side note, Jack&#39;s turret damage is based on DEX. So when you get to vet, you will most likely want to increase his DEX. His turrets, much like Cath&#39;s dolls, increase in level as you do (so their strike and hp go up), and they gain AR/DR every 2 levels. After vet, these dolls/turrets will gain a level every 10% into vet, but they do not get additional AR/DR at 20%. I haven&#39;t tested to see if they get an AR/DR boost at 40%, so I will update when I find out.<br>

                            <br>
                            Notes: While at first glance, Yeganeh may seem similar to Jack, he&#39;s in fact quite inferior to his squeaky old counterpart:<br>
                            <br>
                            Since he can&#39;t use a shield and can&#39;t provoke, Back Guard and Hack and Slash are not nearly as powerful as Jack&#39;s Penetrar Cruz. Structure Build is not as useful as Construction, since his blade constructs are melee. While building his blades right next to his fences might work, this also means that he&#39;ll have to find a way to deal with ranged enemies - he&#39;s going to have a hard time soloing when ranged enemies are constantly picking his blades off from afar. As a plus, Great Rotating Blade will hit flying enemies - but even that will be difficult to take advantage of.<br>
                            <br>
                            In endgame, he can really only contribute with his structures due to his mediocre melee stats and stances. Unfortunately for him, his constructs will die instantly after each boss AE (which happens frequently). Concentration Ward boosts ranged attack damage about 10% (namely rifles, pistols, bayonets, shotguns, cannons... weapons that use DEX as prime damage modifier), so that can be a useful boost to end game dps at times. However, since that&#39;s really the only benefit he&#39;d give to a raid (and it depends how many musks and Grace users you have), it&#39;s hard to justify his presence compared to some other character. Hack and Slash is decent against raid bosses since it&#39;s a medium weapon and he has decent melee stats (6/5/5/7), so that could help boost his usefulness if your guild will spare 2 good 1h swords for him.<br>

                            Stances: Flow Guard, Roof Guard, Tail Guard, Sidewinder (vet), Blandir Cruz, Penetrar Cruz<br>
                            <br>
                            Notes: Idge is a somewhat average melee character. Her problem stems from the fact that around 90% of the monsters in this game are shell or partial cover, and since she can only use heavy-type weapons, she will constantly be suffering damage penalties. Fortunately, she has two unique stances that stock fighters lack: Tail Guard and Penetrar Cruz.<br>
                            <br>
                            Tail Guard is a slow AE-type 2h sword stance, with a 33% atk penalty and around 10-15% aspd penalty. Its AEs are incredibly weak, except for Quarto Taglio which takes 5 years to perform. Generally, this isn&#39;t a good farming stance, though the good thing is each AE knocks down. Armor Crasher is useful on bosses, but it doesn&#39;t land enough to make up for the low dps.<br>
                            <br>
                            Penetrar Cruz is a solid single-target polearm stance with atk/aspd bonuses and the godly arpon (melee version of birdfall shot). Thankfully, even with 6 STR, Blandir Cruz&#39;s 2 AE&#39;s are enough to one-shot kill most monsters during the initial grind, so she&#39;s not too hard to level as long as you have a good polearm. Loop Guard and Flow Guard are decent for boss hunting, but expect to use several pots if you don&#39;t have protection field, even with Highlander Soul active.<br>
                            <br>
                            Overall for PvE, grinding is enjoyable with her fast aspd. And while Tail Guard AE&#39;s don&#39;t often OHKO, they all knockback (and Brandish and Armor Crusher are pretty quick); this gives your other characters some breathing room. However she&#39;s not a reliable tank with her low CON.<br>
                            <br>
                            In end-game, Idge&#39;s higher ASPD won&#39;t help as much as you&#39;d hope, since it&#39;s more effective to skill spam for highest dps. Many Idges decide to pump CON at vet, while non-tank stock fighters tend to pump STR, meaning even without Penetrar Cruz, a stock fighter @ 7 STR should be able to do similar DPS as Idge @ 6 STR if both are skill spamming. Still, using her base 7 AGI with a spear like elite Broinac (22% shock chance) will ensure that the boss is under lightning effect quite often, which is a huge benefit for raid dps.<br>
                            <br>
                            For end-game farming, Idge does quite well with Sidewinder. It&#39;s not a superb stance due to lack of stance bonus, but it has one of the most useful melee AE in the game. Even considering that Sidewinder @ lvl 25 is slower than Tail Guard @ lvl 25, it has a smaller dmg penalty (25% vs Tail Guard&#39;s 33%), so even with a weaker mod on Arc Slash (Sidewinder&#39;s Ultimate AE skill), it does better damage than Tail Guard&#39;s Quarto Taglio. The biggest benefit, however, is the fact Arc Slash takes much less time than Quarto Taglio to execute. (PortCoimbra&#39;s database is incorrect, Sidewinder does not do 1561% dmg @ lvl 10, instead it does 1208% @ lvl 10)<br>

                            <br>
                            Notes: Brunie suffers in all categories mainly due to one reason: lack of Concentration. Or to put it simply, even at maxed stances she will always have low accuracy. I believe the numbers came out to around 85-90 max ACC in Enforcer, and 40-60 ACC in Freestyle and Duality. And unfortunately, 92 uni Quatro Fiend has no ACC bonus, so you&#39;ll need to get 84 elite and try to get ACC mod on it to have any semblance of significant damage.<br>
                            <br>
                            For regular grind, she gravely pales in comparison to stock musk. Her 1 extra AGI does not even come close to making up for the 1 less DEX and lack of Concentrate. Even unnerfed, 2 extra AGI doesn&#39;t come close. Having 40-70 ACC at most times means that she will be doing subpar damage much of the time (the lower your ACC, the lower your min-damage is. When it is 100, your min damage matches your max damage, meaning you will consistently hit for full potential). And since her only decent AE (bloody overdrive) is in Duality stance with 30-45 ACC, don&#39;t expect to OHKO things often. And keep in mind that pistols are generally the most expensive 1h weapons to purchase.<br>
                            <br>
                            For AFK leveling with pistols, she&#39;s either on average (before unnerf) or a bit superior (after unnerf) to stock musk since you won&#39;t be using Concentrate anyway. But then again, the stock musk can AFK with rifle to cover the disadvantage.<br>
                            <br>
                            Where Brunie fares decently is in small scale PvP and Colony Wars. For small scale PvP, she can be used as a stat debuffer, since she can attain the fastest ranged ASPD in the game. Slap on some debuff mods on her pistols and pray for them to land on your opponent before they can reach you. She can also use her fast ranged aspd to damage towers. As you can see, she only fares decently in situations where her damage isn&#39;t necessary.<br>
                            <br>
                            Unfortunately, she dies too easily in AE to be that useful even in Colony Wars. With 4 con and unnable to wear Leather, don&#39;t expect her to stay alive long enough to make too much of a contribution.<br>

                            <br>
                            Notes: I need to preface this by saying I have very limited personal experience with Panfilo. Most of my analysis here is based on firsthand experience with the respective fire spells and saber/sword skills he possesses, in addition to my friends&#39; experiences with him in other GE servers.<br>
                            <br>
                            Panfilo&#39;s problem is that his stats have been distributed too haphazardly to really help him in his fields. He&#39;s part melee and part fire ele, but he can&#39;t do either very well. At least he has a decent melee stance in Hack and Slash, and with 6/5/6/4 he can do decent damage with it... but that&#39;s basically all he has going for him. He will probably have to stay in this stance for the majority of grinding purposes, making him a gimpy stock fighter with no versatility. His unique stance, Flame Guard, isn&#39;t that useful since fire spells generally aren&#39;t known for their end-game efficiency. Fireball is already weak to begin with, and with 6 INT don&#39;t expect to dent much of a monster&#39;s HP. All you&#39;ll accomplish with it is knocking them down and prolonging the fight. Hell&#39;s Breath is decent, but hard to aim and again not very strong with only 6 INT. All of the skills he possesses aren&#39;t very useful at end game either.<br>
                            <br>
                            It&#39;s too bad, the combination of melee and magic is interesting, but unfortunately he got the short end of the stick on both sides. If you want this kind of hybrid, wait for server version 2.2 when we get Karjalainen, who uses a mix of rapier and ice magic... MUCH more useful than mixing sword/saber and fire.<br>

                            <br>
                            Notes: Najib is a rather interesting character. He&#39;s a hybrid of range and melee, but does each just well enough to be significant. Unfortunately, at endgame his lack of specialty makes him fall behind other characters.<br>
                            <br>
                            Before unnerf, his melee stats are arguably better than Adelina&#39;s. He has the same AGI, one less CON, and one more DEX (for a few more crits). He can use her best melee stance (Twin Blades, not the overrated HoH), which is one of the top light-weapon stances (second only to Chapter of Flame). This makes active leveling quite painless. Being able to switch to rifle stances for AFK grinding or semi-AFK is quite helpful also. Although he has 7 DEX like Cath of DEX and Rescue Knight, his higher AGI gives him a higher AFKL rating.<br>
                            <br>
                            His &quot;unique&quot; skills in each of his rifle stances aren&#39;t anything to write home about, and probably will hardly be used when you grind in PvE. They&#39;re much more effective in small scale PvP, since it allows you to stun/knockdown your opponent when they try to get in range of your sniping.<br>
                            <br>
                            However, like I said before, his lack of specialty hurts him in the end. He&#39;s not a good melee dps for raid bosses due to average str, low con, and the fact he can only use light weapons. He&#39;s better used as a gimp Musk with 1 less DEX and no concentrate. He&#39;s not horrible in this role, but you get the sense you&#39;d rather give your elite 84 rifles to someone who can do better damage <img alt="tongue.gif" src="http://forum.swordofthenewworld.com/style_emoticons/default/tongue.gif" title="tongue.gif"><br>
                            <br>
                            His vet stance is quite underachieving as well. The damage is nothing to write home about, he needs to get close to use it, and good bayonets are extremely rare. With that said, he&#39;s probably the best character to use it effectively, since he is a hybrid melee+range character anyway, and when using a bayonet you can freely switch between his rifle stances and his encounter shot. While the auto attack still uses his DEX for damage, the skills factor in STR so he&#39;s more effective than stock musk or Grace.<br>
                            <br>
                            He fares better in small scale PvP, where he can still snipe from afar (though with less DEX than Grace and stock Musk). He&#39;s more durable than them, thanks to 5 con and leather armor, and also has unique abilities to give him some room if people get too close (bayonet assault and crouching kick), but this is mitigated by his low DEX.<br>

                            Stances: Middle Guard, Back Guard, Twin Blades, Hack and Slash, Flow Guard, Tail Guard, Blandir Cruz, Penetrar Cruz, Stave Guard (vet)<br>
                            <br>
                            Notes: Although Claude was probably hit the hardest by the nerf, he&#39;s still quite good even in his current version. He shines especially in PvP where STR and CON are much more important stats for a melee than AGI and DEX since you rely much more heavily on skill spam than auto attack (rendering aspd and crit chance nigh meaningless). Although he isn&#39;t as durable as a high guard fighter (esp since he can&#39;t equip shields), 7 CON and Metal armor makes him incredibly hard to kill by any non-casters. As for offense, Penetrar Cruz is quite useful due to a strong single target skill (Phalanx Locura), a dash skill (Ciento Penetrar), and the ever-useful anti-air Arpon. You can also switch to Blandir Cruz to use Rush if need be, or just switch for the block bonus when moving around.<br>
                            <br>
                            In PvE, he&#39;s still quite useful since he can use an effective stance for every weapon type (Twin Blades for light weapon, Hack and Slash for medium, and his four heavy weapon stances). Blandir Cruz with 7 STR assures you that he can OHKO mobs during grinding with his 2 AE&#39;s.<br>
                            <br>
                            For endgame bosses, being able to spam Phalanx Locura and Rush with 8 STR (using vet point in STR) makes him one of the strongest melee options available. You can make up for his slow sp-charging aspd by spamming SP pot, since he&#39;s one of the few melee who don&#39;t need Protection Field to survive certain powerful AE attacks. This also negates the aspd penalties for wearing metal armor, since all you&#39;re doing is skill spamming anyway. On the other hand, even with 7 CON, he&#39;ll need to be wearing powerful metal to withstand the AE, so don&#39;t expect it to go well with just a 92 Gladiator or something.<br>
                            <br>
                            For PvE farming, he still has enough str to do good damage with his AE&#39;s (although they are no longer OHKO except for the sluggish Quarto Taglio with a elite earthcracker). His high CON and metal allow him to survive longer than most other melee.<br>
                            <br>
                            And keep in mind all this is BEFORE unnerf. After unnerf when he gets 8 str, 8 con (and for me, I would have 9 str with vet point), his advantages are even further pronounced. There&#39;s a reason why he and Grenmah are considered the best melee for PvP in kGE.<br>
                            <br>
                            The reason his PVPL score is much lower than PVPS is that his advantages aren&#39;t as pronounced in colony wars. Obviously with slow aspd, tower attacking is out of the question, but since his AE&#39;s are small compared to casters and cannon, he&#39;s not generally as useful for these purposes either. Plus since everyone&#39;s spamming magic, his high def doesn&#39;t help (although his high CON will help him survive). He&#39;s still useful, just not as dominant as he is in small scale PvP.<br>
                            <br>
                            My main gripe with Claude is his vet stance. Stave Guard is arguably the best pvp stance for stock fighter as long as you can find a good javelin, since it combines the defense, blocking, and DR of a shield with strong one hit skills, buffs, and dashes. Unfortunately, Claude can&#39;t wear shields so he loses big time in the pvp aspect. Zenith is still quite deadly (especially with 9 STR), but it is a light weapon so not as useful against armored opponents. Still, a good stance with the dash and the accel/crit buff, but it&#39;s much more offensive-minded than a stock fighter&#39;s.<br>

                            Stances: Epee Garde, Short Garde, Main Gauche Garde<br>
                            <br>
                            Notes: Andre is a prime example of pure specialist. He sacrifices all other stance versatility to become the unrivaled expert of the rapier (and just looking plain FABULOUS). Even before unnerf, his stats are obviously superior to a stock fighter&#39;s stats... 1 STR and 1 CON is much more important than 1 DEX for a melee warrior. Rapiers are medium weapons and thus have dmg bonus to partial cover (medium) armor like leather, with no dmg penalty to any other armor. The rapier stances also have skills that do additional damage to other armor, like Bladestorm in Epee Garde does 100% extra dmg to light armor, while Berserk in Short Garde does 50% extra dmg to heavy armor. This allows him to be effective to all armor types, which is useful for both pve and pvp. Rapiers also have very good evasion bonuses in addition to small splash damage for auto attack, making it useful in PvE. In fact, being able to shell out damage with 7 STR and high evade thanks to dodge lets him tank bosses fine even without Provoke (and the 7 con ensures he&#39;s more durable than many other melee). He can also easily OHKO leather wearing opponents due to dmg bonus from rapier, and he&#39;s hard to kill off with 7 con and evasion (up to around 65-70 evasion unbuffed, even better with dodge active).<br>
                            <br>
                            Even for end game bosses, Andre shines. The first two main bosses, Diablo and Gerero, can be spammed with Berserk, Sabredance and Flurry for constant skill dps. Later bosses such as Shapen are partial cover, so Andre gets to shine again. This makes him a very effective melee character up there with Claude.<br>
                            <br>
                            Main Gauche Garde is his unique stance, and it allows for limited versatility. Evasion is a good defensive bonus, but ranged attacks can&#39;t be evaded. Also, the more people that are targeting you, the lower your evasion decreases, while blocking suffers no such penalty. Thus in some instances, MG Garde would be preferred for its blocking instead of evasion. The problem, of course, is that blocking is harder to increase via equipment than evasion. Another unique aspect of MG Garde is the inclusion of a decent anti-air in L&#39;arc en Ciel. However, MG Garde doesn&#39;t have the small splash damage that rapiers do.<br>
                            <br>
                            Now for Andre&#39;s drawbacks. His lack of useful AE holds him down in several situations, such as normal PvE grinding, endgame farming, and mass scale PvP where AE is important. This isn&#39;t as important in AFK leveling, since he can still kill quickly against enemies of any armor type with his strong rapier attacks. However, single target dps is still important in endgame farming (since some mobs have upwards of 30k hp), so he&#39;s still quite useful in these instances, especially when you take his high evasion and CON into account.<br>
                            <br>
                            Some people would list his lack of Avant Garde vet stance as a drawback, and they&#39;re partially right. Mortal Eternity is the strongest medium weapon skill in the game (when combined with a good pistol, we&#39;ve tested with elite 84 rapier + elite 84 pistol). However, the main drawback is that between ME cooldowns, you&#39;re left with subpar skills to spam or just auto attack, making it overall less dps on bosses and raidbosses compared to rapier. While you could manually unequip the pistol to use rapier skills, this isn&#39;t possible with Prot Field active, and since Andre cannot equip metal armor, he can rarely survive raid boss AE without PF (even with 7 con). So while the lack of this stance is definitely a drawback, it isn&#39;t as detrimental as one might expect, especially since it&#39;s not too useful in pvp with its lack of defense bonus (why use avant garde when rapier skills are still enough to OHKO most light and medium armor opponents, with the bonus of 60+ evasion?).<br>
                            <br>
                            One last note: since Andre can wear any type of armor and class-specific armor, this means he can wear the Scout-only Capezzolo instead of fighter-only Gladiator if he wants to boost his evasion even further. This type of versatility is quite useful depending on the situation.<br>
