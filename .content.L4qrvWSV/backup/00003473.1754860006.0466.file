                      Armor: Leather, Metal, Shield<br>
                      Stances: Back Guard, High Guard, Hack and Slash, Blandir Cruz, Penetrar Cruz, Defender (vet)<br>
                      <br>
                      Notes: Coimbra Trooper is another underrated UPC due to his lack of versatility. He&#39;s really only good for one thing... but on the other hand, he&#39;s the best at this one thing: tanking. There&#39;s no better tank really than a Coimbra Trooper with vet point in CON and 2 scouts at a distance (outside of AE range) chain masshealing.<br>
                      <br>
                      Sure, his other stats are below average, and he&#39;s difficult to level due to low STR and AGI, but you don&#39;t really need to have either for pure tanking... just alternate spamming between Provoke and Deterrence (and later, Complete Protection once you get a ring), and you&#39;re fine. As long as you have other characters or families for the DPS, Coimbra Trooper is a very effective tank.<br>
                      <br>
                      The problem, of course, is that he&#39;s quite subpar in all other areas. Grinding is difficult, even with Blandir Cruz, since his 5 STR will prevent him from OHKO&#39;ing some enemies later on that Claude, Idge, stock fighters, etc normally can. AFK leveling has the same drawbacks as other melees (running away) except its worse for CT since his attacks are weak and he has damage penalty to the majority of enemies. And being able to survive isn&#39;t nearly as useful in PvP since he can&#39;t really dish out damage or resurrect other players like Rescue Knight or Romina can. Still, he&#39;s worth leveling if you want a solid tank. As such, he&#39;s still useful in high level areas to tank and provoke stronger mobs while your other characters deal the damage.<br>

                      PVPS: 8 ------- LVL: 20<br>
                      PVPL: 3 ------- Personal Skill: Healing<br>
                      Armor: Leather<br>
                      Stances: Bard, Assassin<br>
                      <br>
                      Notes: Yet another underrated UPC. Soho is the only character other than stock scout that has the useful Bard Stance. With Intensify and Fortify rings, he can buff 16% atk, 21% hp, 1 AR and 1 DR, which provides a very big advantage in both PvE and PvP. And unlike stock scout, he can then switch to dagger and deal impressive dps since he has much better melee stats. His 6 STR deals 100% more base damage than scout&#39;s 3 STR ((1.2-0.6)/0.6), though this isn&#39;t as big a difference if you are relying on +ele dmg daggers as is most efficient.<br>
                      <br>
                      Soho isn&#39;t as efficient as stock scout for normal PvE grinding, since he heals for less and he can&#39;t resurrect or massheal (which are useful spells for levels 51-100). However, a stock scout&#39;s heal doesn&#39;t get any stronger after level 50, and by the later levels (esp in 100+ zones), you&#39;ll realize that healing isn&#39;t enough to keep your characters alive, even using greater heal or massheal, thus you will be relying more on pots. In this case, it&#39;s better to bring Soho to buff your characters, then switch to dagger to help kill faster (meaning less pot use since you can then pick up food to help heal your characters).<br>
                      <br>
                      He also shines in PvP, especially at vet level where extra AR and DR are harder to come by. Execute and Heartjab deal impressive damage, so he can hold his own as DPS after buffing. It&#39;s better to rely on pot use than healing anyway, so his lower healing numbers aren&#39;t important. The main disadvantage is lack of resurrecting, but Soho is best used in an offensive minded PvP team (the best defense is a good offense).<br>
                      <br>
                      He&#39;s not as useful in mass scale PvP due to lack of good AE, but can still be used to buff then attack towers with his decent aspd. However, this isn&#39;t too useful since there will undoubtedly be other scouts in your squad that can buff for you, so he&#39;s better off being replaced with either a faster aspd character (Lisa or Irawain for example) or a better AE (Wiz, Ele, Jose, etc).<br>
                      <br>
                      He&#39;s above average in AFK leveling and powerleveling mainly since he can auto heal... however, he&#39;s not as useful as stock scout since he heals for less, but he is more durable than Emilia.<br>
                      <br>

                      <b>Lisa</b><br>

                      Armor: Leather<br>
                      Stances: Assassin, Dos Cuchilos<br>
                      <br>
                      Notes: Lisa is basically Soho with a different secondary stance, no healing, faster aspd and lower base damage. She can attain extremely fast aspd in Dos Cuchilos stance, so she is up there with Irawain as one of the few characters who can reach or get near the lowest aspd cap of 13. Dos Cuchilos also has decent melee AE skills, making grinding a bit easier than some other melee characters. She&#39;s still quite useful as a light weapon specialist, but the fact she can&#39;t do anything else hurts her end game viability.<br>
                      <br>
                      Unfortunately, Dos Cuchilos is nowhere near as useful as Soho&#39;s Bard stance. While it&#39;s fast and especially useful for inflicting status debuffs on enemies, it pales in comparison to Intensify 11 + Fortify 11. Having Lisa in your party would also mean you need a Scout or other healer most of the time while leveling her (and especially when AFK leveling). While she&#39;s still quite useful during AFK level (and powerleveling) due to most monsters being shell armor, it still pales in comparison to Soho if she&#39;s the only one doing dps (since another slot is wasted by a healer).<br>
                      <br>
                      Also, in small scale PvP, Dos Cuchilos is more of a hindrance than a boon. The lack of any defense bonus makes Lisa a sitting duck to be one shot by a skill (while Soho can easily attain 65+ evade). Her additional AGI only increases Evade by 1 point, so her assassin stance isn&#39;t really that different than Soho&#39;s defensively. On the offense, as I noted previously, aspd isn&#39;t as important as skill damage since you won&#39;t be spending that much time auto attacking (time spent auto attacking is time spent being in range of a caster or ranged character&#39;s AE and disables).<br>
                      <br>
                      On the other hand, Dos Cuchilos is nice when powerleveling, since it has 2 decent AE&#39;s and Lisa does not need to worry about the lack of evade if her defense rating is much higher than the monsters&#39; attack rating. Also since most monsters are shell armor, she will be shredding things as long as she has some good daggers.<br>
                      <br>
                      So while it&#39;s nice that she can reach extremely fast aspd and use it to inflict debuffs on opponents, how often will that be useful? In regular PvE grinding, you&#39;d rather just kill a monster instead of debuffing. In small scale PvP, it&#39;s all about powerful skill usage and disable AE (meaning using Dos Cuchilos is a deathwish). In large scale PvP, her only role would be killing towers with her fast aspd. In PvE raid, the debuffs won&#39;t land often enough to make her miniscule damage worth it. It&#39;s really only useful for normal boss hunting, but by the time you hit vet, most of these bosses will become pushovers anyway.<br>
                      <br>
                      In the end, Lisa&#39;s only real advantage is killing towers quickly and stylishly.<br>
                      <br>

                      <br>
                      Notes: The only other healing UPC along with Soho, I strangely see more of her than I do of him. Is it the girl-next-door looks or just her exposed belly button? Regardless, she&#39;s a bit overrated due to her lack of Bard stance and lower CON than Soho and Stock Scout.<br>
                      <br>
                      Her unique feature is the ability to use ESP and Incantation. ESP&#39;s most popular feature is deservedly Protection Field. However, this doesn&#39;t make up for lack of Bard buffs, especially since PF only lasts for about 45 seconds. It&#39;s very useful in boss fights, but for all other purposes in grinding, Bard buffs far outweigh PF, especially with Intensify and Fortify rings. She also heals for less than stock scout (healing is determined by the combined total of DEX + INT, so she heals for about 80 less than stock scout), although more than Soho. She&#39;s not really too useful in PvP either since she dies more easily than scout and Soho, she can&#39;t do any dps, and auto healing isn&#39;t really that vital in these situations.<br>
                      <br>
                      The only area where she does alright is endgame boss fights, since she can be used as a utility character, resurrecting dead players and casting PF on melee and casters (if AE is large enough). She&#39;s still decent at AFKing since you need a healer anyway, but since she&#39;s less durable than a stock scout, she has a lower AFKL rating.<br>
                      <br>
                      Incantation is a decent stance, but extremely situational, so you probably won&#39;t be using it much. Ignore Harm is good for certain PvP setups, and Howling of Heaven is basically like Menace Shot except it reduces your opponents&#39; SP to 0 as well. However, it has a long cast time, and with 4 CON she&#39;ll probably bite the dust before she can get the spell off.<br>

                      <br>
                      Notes: Ah, Grace. One of the most popular and abundant characters in all other GE versions due to her 9 DEX. With the nerf, she&#39;s arguably worse than stock musk since she has 1 less CON, 1 more AGI ,and no Concentrate. However, she can still hold her own in many areas.<br>
                      <br>
                      For PvE active leveling, she lacks any decent AE (without Concentrate, Bloody Overdrive will rarely OHKO). Scatter Shot is decent, but the radius is too small to be consistently useful. Thus Grace is better used as a secondary DPS, picking off stragglers while your main AE grinder kills most mobs. She fares well during boss fights (both raid and non-raid) due to her high single target damage. She can skill spam by rotating Execution Shot, Precision Shot, and Headshot, then switch back to Sniper stance to auto attack while waiting for cooldowns. Her main problem while active leveling is her low CON... even with leather armor, she&#39;s quite fragile. Also, after 80, it&#39;s quite difficult to find 84+ leather armor, confining her to musk-only armor like Corso Rosso, which is a coat. She can wear 84 elite ringmail, but she will probably have low priority in obtaining this, and she can&#39;t wear the 92 fighter-only or scout-only leather armor.<br>
                      <br>
                      Where Grace really shines is AFK leveling, which is why she&#39;s so popular. Here her lack of Concentrate isn&#39;t noticeable, and her faster ASPD helps pick up the kill rate. Since rifles are medium weapons, she won&#39;t have any dmg penalty against armor either. With unnerfed 9 DEX, she has the best OHKO potential of any character during AFK, but even with 8 DEX, she&#39;s quite feared. In addition to this, her shotgun blaster stance makes her a superb powerleveler, since it is a light weapon and does extra dmg bonus to light armor. This means she can solo several high-spawn areas with light monsters, including the ever-popular underground relics. Shotgun isn&#39;t as useful during active leveling, since when fighting mobs of similar level, it will do pretty horrible damage compared to rifles.<br>
                      <br>
                      Now for raid boss, she is one of the best dps characters, second only to stock musk with Conc ring. Concentration ring gives the stock musk +32 accuracy and +16 crit bonus, in addition to +1 AR. While the acc bonus isn&#39;t important for rifle users (it&#39;s easy to reach 100 acc with proper equipment), the extra crit and additional AR effectively increase the stock musk&#39;s dps by over 20% (10% from AR, and another 10% from not missing since most raid bosses will have higher DR than your AR).<br>
                      <br>
                      However, this changes after unnerf... when that happens, Grace will be on par (though still slightly weaker than stock musk with Conc ring). Increasing DEX from 8-&gt;9 gives an effective base dmg bonus of 12.5% ((1.8-1.6)/1.6). However, if both Grace and Musk put vet point into DEX, then the increase will only be 11.1% ((2.0-1.8)/1.8). This doesn&#39;t make up for the extra AR if the raid boss has higher DR than you. Still, it&#39;s not like Conc rings grow on trees, so this trade off is sometimes worth it.<br>
                      <br>
                      Grace&#39;s main role in PvP would be to snipe enemies from afar and birdfall wizards. Menace Shot is extremely handy if you choose to go that route, though it&#39;s self-centered so it requires Grace to be relatively close when casting. If the fear fails (which is quite possible if the enemy is using Ignore Harm), consider Grace a goner. It&#39;s still quite handy in mass-scale PvP, though her low CON makes it a risky proposition. She can also choose to stand far away and snipe people with her far-range skills like Execution Shot, while hoping no one notices her.<br>

                      Stances: Middle Guard, Back Guard, Twin Blades, Heaven or Hell, Freestyle, Duality<br>
                      <br>
                      Notes: Adelina also suffered quite a bit from the stat nerf. Her main defining quality is her aspd in combination with the strong Twin Sabers stance (one of the better light weapon stances). However, with the nerf, Najib actually does this better (same AGI, less CON, greater DEX). In order for her to become unique again, she really needs the unnerf to bump her AGI back to 8. This will allow her to attain fast aspd again (and sabers are much stronger than Lisa&#39;s daggers).<br>
                      <br>
                      Twin Blades is similar to a stock Fighter&#39;s Hack and Slash with a few key differences. Sabers are a light weapon, so it has dmg bonus to shell/light armor, and penalties to other armor types. Cross Penetration does similar damage to Gutripper (although the dmg% mod is smaller, sabers have higher base ATK than swords), but it execute much faster, which is a bonus in most aspects.<br>
                      <br>
                      Her HoH stance is arguably better than stock Fighter&#39;s, since she uses a Saber + Pistol instead of Sword + Pistol, and most monsters have shell armor (plus Sabers are generally stronger than swords). However, I still don&#39;t think this stance is good for anything other than looking good; the attack cycles take too long, it has no good AE, and the ultimate skill takes forever to execute compared to Cross Penetration. All the vet Adelinas in my clan prefer Twin Blades over HoH for farming and grinding.<br>
                      <br>
                      Adelina&#39;s biggest downfall in PvP is her lack of defense bonus in her main stances. Although with 6 CON and Leather armor, she&#39;s not too fragile, her inability to block or parry skills can make or break a fight. After unnerf, she&#39;ll be a decent candidate to work on towers, though Lisa and Irawain will generally have faster aspd.<br>
                      <br>
                      Her strong light weapon stances and equipment make her a prime choice for grinding since most mobs have shell armor, so this is where she shines the most. When she reaches endgame, her advantages level off, so much so that most people with vet Adelina decide to replace her with another character (our two vet Adelina users replaced her with Jack and Andre, respectively).<br>

                      <br>
                      Notes: Gracielo&#39;s most useful attribute is the level you obtain him. With proper equipment and strategy, it&#39;s not impossible to obtain his lvl 40 card at lvl 28 (though it&#39;s easier at 32). This lets you acquire quests that you normally can&#39;t and powerlevel your character if you choose to do so.<br>
                      <br>
                      Unfortunately, our spiky haired friend doesn&#39;t do much else. Leg Guards are some of the weakest weapons, so even with light weapon bonus on shell armor, he still does quite piddly damage in PvE, and his 2 AE&#39;s quickly become unable to OHKO monsters. Contrary to some belief, leg guards are not faster than knuckles (easy to test with Irawain who can use chapter of flame with both knuckles and leg guards); they&#39;re just weaker. And while atomic rush is idolized by new players, it takes a long time to execute; and with a long cooldown and no other decent skills, Gracielo is basically just kick-kick-kicking away for piddly damage and no versatility.<br>
                      <br>
                      Gracielo&#39;s not too bad against bosses due to his high evasion, but rapier characters (like stock fighter or Andre) do much better in this regard. In PvP, he can only use his rush once then has to run away until it cools down since he has no other useful skills.. problem is, even with 84 elite or 92 uni leg guards, he can&#39;t even OHKO a decently equipped scout (and that&#39;s assuming it doesn&#39;t get parried). After he shoots his proverbial load, he can&#39;t do much else except hope that he&#39;s not killed before he can rush again.<br>
                      <br>
                      For Colony Wars, Gracielo is best utilized for attacking the towers with his fast aspd, and not much else.<br>
                      <br>
                      Another drawback: his Stance of Wind book is a pain to get, while other martial characters automatically start with their stances. However, if you already have a vet character, you can hunt Phobiton General in Toflo Duraga (level 100+ boss), since he occasionally drops the stance book.<br>

                      <br>
                      Notes: Personally, I&#39;m not a fan of M&#39;boma because I feel that stock Wiz and Ele do everything he can but better. But I have to admit that he still has his strengths, especially in PvP.<br>
                      <br>
                      His ability to use Levitation already puts him way up on PVEG and PVEF. Levitation is one of the most overpowered PvE stances in the game. Consider this:<br>
                      - Most monsters cannot hit Levitators, but will still try (letting them effectively tank)<br>
                      - Levitation auto attack range increased about 2x, and has a 3-target splash damage<br>
                      - Levitators move at a much faster rate than normal<br>
                      - Levitators have 3 good AE spells to cast, 1 for pure damage, 1 for damage + 75% stun and &quot;black hole&quot; effect, 1 for disabling<br>
                      <br>
                      Though Wizard can do all of this too in addition to other useful things (like ESP and Psychokinesis), I must admit that the sole inclusion of Levitation automatically brings M&#39;boma quite high in these ratings. Having access to Anathema lets him be even more useful when farming 104+ iceland maps in squads by spamming Curse to increase overall DPS. (Fire is good in these maps, but lightning is best, since Ice is weak to Lightning, not Fire)<br>
                      <br>
                      However, he&#39;s a horrible boss killer, since he lacks the basic Strikeback spam of Psychokinesis, and Fire elemental stances do not have any good single target spells. He&#39;ll mostly rely on Hell Breath spam, and Levi to get rid of adds, but his spot is better taken by someone else who can do better dps (not to mention he shouldn&#39;t be tanking, nor can he hold aggro). For endgame raids, he&#39;d be relegated to HoD stun duty for certain bosses since he still lacks any good single target spells.<br>
                      <br>
                      For powerlevel AFK, he&#39;s decent since Domination Fire has solid damage and splash attack, but the aspd is so slow it&#39;s not as effective as other powerlevelers.<br>
                      <br>
                      M&#39;boma shines more during PvP, where his 2 extra CON is generally more useful than his lack of stances and lower INT (than Ele). Since he&#39;ll be staying in Levi most of the time anyway, his higher CON protects him from birdfall and arpon while he attempts to AE disable with Reverse and HoD. If you think you are being targeted by anti air, switching to Evo Fire and using a AE knockup like Infernal Flames is also an option. Still, for small scale PvP, I&#39;d prefer a Wiz for either Anti Magic Shell, Protection Field, or Ignore Harm, but he&#39;s generally on par with them since he is more durable.<br>

                      <br>
                      Notes: One of the creepiest looking UPCs I&#39;ve yet to see, I keep expecting him to be arrested for his sexual innuendos about beating his Roby ######. Regardless, he&#39;s basically a slower Claude with higher STR but cannot equip metal. After unnerf, he&#39;ll still have higher STR than Claude, but will have 1 less CON. He&#39;s also less versatile than Claude, since he can only use heavy weapons (much like Idge), but cannot use the best single target 2h sword stance (Roof Guard).<br>
                      <br>
                      His normal grinding is quite painful with his slow aspd. Most people won&#39;t want to spam SP pots to use skills just while leveling, so you&#39;ll still have to rely on his slow auto attack to get SP for his powerful AE&#39;s in Blandir Cruz. This is fine if he&#39;s your secondary DPS, but if you&#39;re using Alejandro as your main damage output, be prepared for a long fight. He fares a bit better on bosses but since most aren&#39;t hard armor, he still won&#39;t fare too well here.<br>
                      <br>
                      In early raid bosses, he does quite well by spamming between Phalanx Locura and Rush @ 9 STR (with vet point). However, his inability to wear metal means he probably needs Protection Field, limiting his ability to spam since he can&#39;t use SP pots... so he&#39;ll then have to rely on his dismal auto attack to gain SP. Hardly a enviable proposition.<br>
                      <br>
                      His inability to equip metal hurts even more in PvP since 7 con and leather makes him equal to Andre without the evasion.<br>
                      <br>
                      Also keep in mind that increasing STR from 7-&gt;8 (Claude -&gt; Alejandro) is only a difference of 14% ((1.6-1.4)/1.4) and at vet point, 8-&gt;9 is only a difference of 12.5%. After unnerf, the difference of 9-&gt;10 is only 11.1%. As you can see, these damage increases aren&#39;t really worth all his other disadvantages compared to his fat counterpart. It also doesn&#39;t help that the only 2 90+ Alejandros I met were botters. And his creepy mustache and grin! The nightmares!!<br>

                      Stances: Blandir Cruz, Penetrar Cruz, Siege Burst, Gigantic Marksmanship (vet)<br>
                      <br>
                      Notes: Jose is the perfect example of a character that&#39;s so specialized in one area that he utterly underachieves in every other area.<br>
                      <br>
                      His melee stats are some of the worst in the game, he&#39;s not too durable with only 5 CON (though being able to wear metal helps). Blandir Cruz AE&#39;s with 5 STR won&#39;t always be enough to OHKO monsters, and with 4 AGI his auto attack is no better. Obviously he&#39;s not too effective fighting or tanking bosses with those stats either, and his low melee stats lowers his polearm spam against hard armor raid bosses as well.<br>
                      <br>
                      In addition to that, his default cannon stance has no auto attack, and even his skills don&#39;t really do that much damage. Cannons are expensive to purchase and upgrade, and cannon shots cost an arm and a leg if you&#39;re spamming skills.<br>
                      <br>
                      So what exactly is this Burger King mascot reject good for? Colony wars, baby! He&#39;s able to continually spam knockdown AE&#39;s to disable players from doing anything. His first Canon AE hits 7 targets while his last one hits 10. His vet stance also has auto attack with AE skills that can inflict debuffs. He&#39;s basically there only for mass PvP, preventing others from doing anything.<br>

                      <br>
                      PVEG: 8 ------- STR: 8<br>

                      PVEB: 8 ------- CON: 5<br>
                      PVER: 2 ------- DEX: 5<br>

                      PVPL: 8 ------- Personal Skill: None<br>
                      Armor: Leather<br>
                      Stances: Chapter of Wind, Chapter of Earth, Chapter of Flame<br>
                      <br>
                      Notes: Irawain is our newest UPC, and is often idolized as the best DPS in the game, probably due to the fact many people don&#39;t have him yet but see his high STR and high dmg mods in his stances. While this isn&#39;t completely false, that&#39;s definitely not the whole picture.<br>
                      <br>
                      Irawain is, for all means and purposes, the top tier dps for light weapon users. He has a decent AE in Fire Striking Power and Lionheart, a superb buff in Phantom Strike (atk and aspd bonus, in addition to +1 AR with ring), and 3 powerful ultimate abilities (Lion Straight Strike, Atomic Bomber, Atomic Rush). This allows him to perform extremely well in normal grinding, since most enemies are shell armor anyway. Even without consistent AE, he works well powerleveling due to his fast and strong attacks. He&#39;s even quite useful in AFK leveling and powerleveling; he&#39;s the only melee character I&#39;ve seen that can one hit kill each mob in Toflo with one attack cycle.<br>
                      <br>
                      However, he&#39;s not the perfect melee for several reasons. His low CON makes him quite vulnerable in PvP, where some people seem to think he reigns as God over all. Not so; since he uses light weapon, of course he can kill casters and some leather-wearing scouts, but he still has trouble with fighters and metal users. In this regard, he&#39;s not really any better DPS-wise than Andre, but with much less HP and defense bonuses. He still has a tough time against metal armor and people with high evade, but unlike Gracielo and Gertrude, if one of his ultimates gets blocked, he can switch to another stance and use a different ultimate. However, his low CON makes him vulnerable to other melee DPS and casters, so he&#39;s really a glass cannon.<br>
                      <br>
                      In large scale PvP, he fares rather well since he&#39;s strong enough to kill most people that get close to him, but his main purpose is to attack the tower with his superb aspd. With correct buffs stacked on him, he can easily reach 16-17 aspd with 92 uni knuckles, and with 76 uni knuckles (40% aspd), he can reach the cap of 13 aspd.<br>
                      <br>
                      Like all light weapon specialists, he&#39;s rather useless for endgame raids, mostly for Diablo and Gerero. While other bosses are partial armor, the only shell raid boss that he might be useful for is Griffon, but no one will be killing that boss for a long time.<br>
                      <br>
                      Overall, he&#39;s the best light weapon DPS in the game, but this is balanced out by his low CON. Use with caution!<br></font>
